# Using-Microsoft-Windows-Terminal-for-Git
Instead of using Git Bash, which doesn't have a very user-friendly interface and experience, here's how to create the perfect Git Bash profile to push commits using Microsoft Windows Terminal.


First, go to the Microsoft Store, download, and install "Windows Terminal."

Click the down arrow, choose settings, and create a new profile with the name and tab title "Git Bash." The command line should be the .exe file of Git Bash.

Once you do that, in the window of your Git Bash Profile, click the settings gear on the bottom left, and a .json file will be opened.

Back that .json file to any text file, and then copy and paste the text in the .json file of this repo to the original .json file to get the final look of the terminal.
